    <p> suddenly, you are given a menu of pastas that you have never seen before. <em>oh no!</em> you think, <em> what am I going to do?</em> </p>

    <p style="color:red; font-size: 30px"> <strong> My Top 5 Favorite Pasta Shapes </strong> </p>

    <p> <strong> 5. Bowties </strong></p>

        height="150" <br>

    <p>sometimes, youâ€™ve gotta go with a classic. Bowties have always been fun to eat. However, I find it annoying when they un-bowtie. I also dislike that you have to meticulously place your fork between the folds to keep it from falling apart.</p> 

    <p> <strong> 4. Gemelli </strong> </p>

        height="150" <br>
    <p> These are super fun to eat. They hold a lot of sauce (both in the hole and outside), plus are twisty! </p>

    <p> <strong> 3. Casarecce </strong></p>

        height="150" <br>
    <p> These are like sophisticated rigatonis. It is nice when the shape starts un-twisting because  you can pull it apart (kind of like a cheese stick).</p>

    <p> <strong> 2. Conch </strong></p>

        height="150" <br>
    <p> imagine you could digest tiny bowls. now imagine eating several tiny bowls of sauce in one bite. that is what the conch is like. </p>

    <p> <strong> 1. Insalatonde </strong></p>

        height="150" <br> 
    <p> These are perfect in every way possible. They are thick in some parts to maintain the pasta dough flavor, while the bowl part still holds a lot of sauce that bursts in your mouth. 10/10
